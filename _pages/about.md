Hi! My name is Wanying Ma. I am a fifth-year Ph.D. Candidate in the [Department of Statistics](https://www.stat.ncsu.edu) at [North Carolina State University](https://www.ncsu.edu/) under supervision of [Prof. Luo Xiao](https://www.stat.ncsu.edu/people/xiao/). 

Before the colorful life at NC State, I received my Bachelor's Degree from [School of Mathematical Sciences](http://math.english.bnu.edu.cn/) at [Beijing Normal University](http://english.bnu.edu.cn/). During the college time, I spent two years on several time series prediction research projects under supervision of Prof. Xiaohua Yang. Since then I was greatly attracted by the beauty of statistics in real life and collaboration with teammates.

My graduate research interests lie in the functional data analysis with biostatistical applications, particularly in mixed modeling, dimension reduction and classification. I also have hands-on experiences in machine learning, consulting, clinical data analysis, R package development and data base.
