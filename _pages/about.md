Hi! My name is Wanying Ma. I am a fifth-year Ph.D. Candidate in the [Department of Statistics](https://www.stat.ncsu.edu) at [North Carolina State University](https://www.ncsu.edu/) under supervision of [Prof. Luo Xiao](https://www.stat.ncsu.edu/people/xiao/). 

Before joining NC State, I received my Bachelor's Degree from [School of Mathematical Sciences](http://math.english.bnu.edu.cn/) at [Beijing Normal University](http://english.bnu.edu.cn/). During the college time, I spent two years on several time series forecasting research projects based on phase reconstruction, KNN and connection degree under supervision of Prof. Xiaohua Yang. Since then I was greatly attracted by the beauty of statistics in real life and collaboration with teammates.

My PhD thesis topic is New Methods in [Functional Data Analysis](https://functionaldata.wordpress.ncsu.edu/)  with Biostatistical Applications. Specifically, my graduate research interests lie in the functional linear model, functional principal component analysis, testing, mixed modeling, and classification. I also have hands-on experiences in machine learning techniques, spatial modeling, consulting, clinical data analysis, R-shiny and R package development.
