## A Novel Testing Method for Random Functional Effects in A fMRI Pain Study
- Established a new functional linear mixed model for scalar on function regression using continuous fMRI brain activation data with random functional effects to predict pain response- Proposed a novel equal-variance test to assess the existence of the random subject-specific functional effects- The proposed test has good size and better power property compared to the Bonferroni-corrected test in 24 simulated cases. Proposed equal variance test and Bonferroni-corrected test are denoted as solid black line and red dashed line, respectively in the following figure.

- The data application on a fMRI thermal pain study indicates significant subject-specific effects of human brain hemodynamics related to pain and provides insights on how the effects might differ across subjects

## Computional Spatial Data Analysis
- Built a spatial poisson model and conditional autogressive (CAR) model to evaluate the association between states homicide rate and LASSO selected state gun laws
- Established a spatiotemporal model for predicting the street crimes in August 2016 using a real-time large dataset on ``day call for service" records for street crimes in Portland (2012/03/01 - 2016/07/31). The predicted crime and original crime records in August 2016 for Portland are shown as follows:
